# Open Fresno Website testing library

Add tests here that are **important** for the website. They should use the Playwright library. Other tests can be found in the [documentation repository](https://openfresno.org/fe-openfresno.org-doc/testing). They include Storybook, vitest, non-critical tests, and example code.
